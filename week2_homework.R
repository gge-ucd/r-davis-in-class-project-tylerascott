#Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 vector to create a new vector called plus10.

#Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long that looks exactly like this one:
